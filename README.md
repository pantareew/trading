# DecTraSys Trading Platform

## Project Overview
  The goal of this project is to establish a decentralized trading platform that enables users to conduct seamless transactions with digital assets, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as banks or brokers for fund transfer and custody.

## Key Features:

* Decentralized Exchange: Users can engage in trading activities without relying on intermediaries. The entire transaction process is facilitated through blockchain technology and immutable smart contracts.

* Blockchain Technology: The project leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent transaction activities. This enhances the trust and reliability of the trading platform.

* Smart Contracts Implementation: Solidity contracts are implemented to automate and secure various aspects of the trading process. These contracts are executed on the Ethereum blockchain.

* API Integration: The project includes comprehensive API endpoints, enabling seamless communication between the front-end and back-end components. This ensures efficient data flow and enhances the overall functionality of the trading platform.

* Blockchain Simulation with Ganache: To facilitate testing and development, a simulated blockchain environment using Ganache is deployed. This allows for a personal Ethereum Blockchain setup, ensuring thorough  of the implemented Solidity contracts.

## Involved Technologies:
* React
* Material UI
* Web3.py
* FastAPI
* Solidity
* Ganache
* MySQL
